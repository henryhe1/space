Hello internet wanderer! The idea of a static blog was inspired by my good friend Ed [(edho.me)](http://edho.me) and serves as a space for my thoughts and reflections. We're all in this swirling, sometimes laminar and sometimes turbulent river called life, but if we just step out and sit on the shore every once in a while, it can lead to a more enriched and personally meaningful experience.

### tech stuff

This blog is built on Hugo, and on an amazing theme called [Natrium](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-natrium-theme/). I chose it because of its simplicity as well as the ability to sort by tags and categories. In the future I'd like to implement a site-wide search feature.

The font used is [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito).
