      <description>Hello internet wanderer. The idea of a static blog was inspired by my good friend Ed (edho.me) and serves as a space for my thoughts and reflections. We&amp;rsquo;re all in this swirling, sometimes laminar and sometimes turbulent river called life, but if we just step out and sit on the shore every once in a while, it can lead to a more enriched and personally meaningful experience.
tech stuff This blog is built on Hugo, and on an amazing theme called Natrium.</description>

      <description>Walruses Those drizzles are nothing more than mothers. Dewlapped laborers show us how flowers can be entrances. Nowhere is it disputed that the candle is a banker. The walruses could be said to resemble malar floors.
